# Weact #
### Wee little recreation of React ###

A dive into React's magic through recreating its core features.

## Features ##

* JSX parsing via Babel, Rollup, and Weact.createElement. Use JSX syntax to your heart's content!

* Class and pure functional components, including all standard lifecycle methods, props, and state.

* Processes and updates event handlers, attributes, and inline styles to the DOM

* Features an incremental rendering, time-slicing reconciliation workflow inspired by the new React Fiber architecture. Reconciliation with the virtual DOM doesn't block the thread, woo hoo! This post on my blog gives more details on how I implemented this.

## Future Additions ##

I hope to add to this project with my own implementations of:

* React Router (Weact Wouter)
* Redux (Wedux)
